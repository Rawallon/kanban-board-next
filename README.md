## üéØ About

Nello was initially created to be a Trello clone but it just kept expanding to full fledge project.<br/>
With this project the goal was to expand my knowledge with library I had heard but never got the chance to use it (or use it in depth). Which was the case for both Next API routes and websockets, with both I had some familiarity but never tried to bend this far to see what were they capable.

PS: If you're looking at this because you're interested in DnD, you might want to check [this other repo](https://github.com/Rawallon/kanban-board-react-context) where I implement it without any external library.<br/><br/>
Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would appreciate it a lot.
